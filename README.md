# GenomePrep
To preprocess, quality control and prepare consumer DTC genomes for research

## Official webserver
https://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/GenomePrep/

## Incentive
The open-source GenomePrep tool-kit, developed on the goodwill of open genome data, addresses the problem of processing raw DTC DNA data in the context of the present: genotype arrays. The output of GenomePrep are DNA datafiles of homogenous formats (23andMe-like or vcf), which enable further research analysis. A single combined data-freeze of genomes that passed checks is also available in official website.

## Feature
1. Developed based on over 7,000 open genetic data
2. Automatic processing any inputs, identify genome from zip files, automatic parsing, converting various DTC genome formats into 23andMe-like format or VCF format. 
3. Automatic recognition of chip array version
4. Supply possibly problematic SNP position filter, stats developed from processing genetic data.

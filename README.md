# GenomePrep
To preprocess, quality control and prepare consumer DTC genomes for research
Official website: 

## Incentive
To facilitate you (and myself) conducting genetic research with public participants.

## Feature
1. Developed based on over 7,000 open genetic data
2. Automatic processing any inputs, identify genome from zip files, automatic parsing, converting various DTC genome formats into 23andMe-like format or VCF format. 
3. Automatic recognition of chip array version
4. Supply possibly problematic SNP position filter, stats developed from processing genetic data.
